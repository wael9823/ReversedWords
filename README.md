# ReversedWords

In this repository, we will see four different ways of solving the common c++ programming interview question, reverse the words of a given sentence. 

We first take up an approach that I think is the first idea we get of solving this problem and improve it as much as we can in two further programs. In the final method, we see an approach that is nothing short of a magic trick according to me.

If you are someone who opts for a video explanation of the code, do checkout this video.

If you are a person that prefers to read the explanation for the code, please go through this article. Hopefully it will make up for the small errors that I have made here and there in the video.
